# AlgorithmiWebVersion
Online Fluxogram Editor and Executor

#Stable "Release Candidate":
Optmized for chrome and firefox, scroll zoom wont work in firefox. 
While the issue "cross-bowser" is open, i strongly advice to run on chrome.

In order to run, this is not available online yet, you'll need to download, extract the full content to a folder, select the index.html file and you're ready to enjoy.
